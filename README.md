HealthTracker: An AI-Enabled Body Area Network for Enhanced Health Monitoring
Overview
HealthTracker is an AI-powered health monitoring system that simulates and analyzes patient health data without requiring physical wearable sensors. The system generates realistic health parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen levels, and ECG signals to create a virtual testing, training, and prediction environment for healthcare professionals.
Project Architecture
The system consists of five primary layers:

Data Simulation Layer: Generates simulated physiological parameters
Data Transmission Layer: Transfers data from simulation to cloud processing
Data Processing Layer: Applies machine learning algorithms to identify anomalies
Notification Layer: Alerts healthcare providers about detected anomalies
User Interface Layer: Provides access to health insights, trends, and alerts
