# HealthTracker: An AI-Enabled Body Area Network for Enhanced Health Monitoring

## Overview

**HealthTracker** is an AI-powered health monitoring system that simulates and analyzes patient health data without requiring physical wearable sensors. The system generates realistic health parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen levels, and ECG signals, creating a virtual environment for testing, training, and prediction by healthcare professionals.

## Project Architecture

The system consists of five primary layers:

1. **Data Simulation Layer** – Generates simulated physiological parameters  
2. **Data Transmission Layer** – Transfers data from simulation to processing modules  
3. **Data Processing Layer** – Applies machine learning algorithms to identify anomalies  
4. **Notification Layer** – Alerts healthcare providers about detected anomalies  
5. **User Interface Layer** – Provides access to health insights, trends, and alerts
